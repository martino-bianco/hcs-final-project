# HCS Travel BLog 2

This is my final project for the [Hamburg Coding School](https://hamburgcodingschool.com/):
Building a travel blog with focus on vue and it's usage of components.

I'm also working on a second repository which is the same project but with a working backend.

Have fun checking it out and laughing at my code ðŸ¤“!
